            <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young
               physicist named Alan Guth, with a new son and a year’s appointment
               at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and equations,
               venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
            </p>

            <p>
              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
              particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
              discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with.
              A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could
              have infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
              force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a
              prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>

              He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic
              particles that should have been created in the Big Bang. Instead he
              discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin with. A

              infused space itself with a special energy that exerted a repulsive
              force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light
              for a prodigiously violent instant.
            </p>

            <p>
              “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page
              and drew a double box around it.
            </p>

            <p>On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.</p>

            <p>
              Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to <a href="#"> the first sliver of cosmic </a>
              time with telescopes at the South Pole, a team of astronomers led
              by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics
              detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called
              <a href="#"> gravitational waves </a> — the signature of a universe
              being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of
              a trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the
              long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, proof, Dr. Kovac and
              his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
            </p>

            <p>
              Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though
               many, including Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
             </p>

            <p>
              If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in
               science comparable to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing
               the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. It would open vast
               realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
             </p>

             <p>
               Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending
                14 billion light-years in space with its hundreds of billions of galaxies,
                is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose extent,
                architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own
                universe there might be an endless number of other universes
                bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.
              </p>

              <h3>‘As Big as It Gets’</h3>


              <p>
                In our own universe, it would serve as a window into the forces
                operating at energies forever beyond the reach of particle accelerators
                on Earth and yield new insights into gravity itself. Dr. Kovac’s
                ripples would be the first direct observation of gravitational waves,
                which, according to Einstein’s theory of general relativity, should
                ruffle space-time.
              </p>

              <p>
                Marc Kamionkowski of Johns Hopkins University, an early-universe
                expert who was not part of the team, said, “This is huge, as big
                as it gets.”
              </p>

              <p>
                He continued, “This is a signal from the very earliest universe,
                sending a telegram encoded in gravitational waves.”
              </p>

              <p>
                The ripples manifested themselves as faint spiral patterns in a
                bath of microwave radiation that permeates space and preserves a
                picture of the universe when it was 380,000 years old and as hot
                as the surface of the sun.
              </p>

              <p>
                Dr. Kovac and his collaborators, working in an experiment known
                as Bicep, for Background Imaging of Cosmic Extragalactic Polarization,
                reported their results in a scientific briefing at the Center for
                Astrophysics here on Monday and in a set of papers submitted to The
                Astrophysical Journal.

                  Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of
                  inflation, which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly
                  and so quickly in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                    <strong> THE UNIVERSE </strong> is just under 14 billion years old. From our
                    position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a sphere
                    that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But there's
                    a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even temperature.

                    <strong> NOT ENOUGH TIME </strong> The universe is not old
                    enough for light to have traveled the vast distance from one
                    side of the universe to the other, and there has not been enough
                    time for scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even temperature.

                    <strong> DISTANT COFFEE </strong>  At a smaller scale, imagine using a telescope
                    to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup, and from
                    the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature and how
                    much it has cooled.

                    direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly the same
                    temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a similar cup
                    in every direction, you might want to look for another explanation.

                  <strong> STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME </strong> There has not been
                  enough time to carry coffee cups from place to place before
                  they get cold. But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled
                  from a single coffee pot, all at the same time, that might
                  explain their even temperature.

              <div>
                <p>
                  <strong> INFLATION </strong> solves this problem. The theory
                  proposes that, less than a trillionth of a second after the
                  Big Bang, the universe expanded faster than the speed of light.
                  Tiny ripples in the violently expanding energy field eventually
                  grew into the large-scale structures of the universe.

              <div>
                <p>
                  <strong>EXPANSION</strong> Returning to our coffee, imagine a
                  single, central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to
                  an even temperature as it expands. That is something like
                  inflation. And the structure of the universe mirrors the froth
                  and foam of the original pot.

            The results are the closely guarded distillation of three years’
            worth of observations and analysis. Eschewing email for fear of a leak,
            Dr. Kovac personally delivered drafts of his work to a select few,
            meeting with Dr. Guth, who is now a professor at Massachusetts Institute
            of Technology (as is his son, Larry, who was sleeping that night in
