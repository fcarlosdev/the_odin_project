# PROJECT LIBRARY

This is the first project of the Javascritp Course from TheOdinProject.

## Description

In this project I'm creating a book library app that has the follow features:

. Iclusion of a new book in the lybrary;
. Updating of a status of the book ( that status indicating if the book already was read or not);
. Exclusion of a book from the library;

All behavior of this app is made in JavaScript, and to the visual are applying a basic css.

Click [Library App](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/fcarlosdev/the_odin_project/blob/master/library/index.html), to see the final result.
