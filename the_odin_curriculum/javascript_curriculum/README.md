# The Odin Project - Javascript Curriculum

This is the repo for the development of a new Javascript course for The Odin Project.  We are convinced that we host one of the best free web development curriculums on the internet and that our teaching style is the most effective when it comes to online self-directed learning.  This material will gradually be merged into our existing site \([https://www.theodinproject.com/ \)](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and it is also available in a gitbook here: [https://the-odin-project.gitbooks.io/javascript-curriculum/](https://the-odin-project.gitbooks.io/javascript-curriculum/)

## Mission statement

**Our main focus** is the cultivation and sequencing of best free resources around the internet. We believe wholeheartedly that everything one needs to know to become employed can be found for free online, but for the average new learner, the vast amount \(and widely varying quality\) of resources makes it difficult to make a meaningful progress.  We have devised a three basic steps to fix this.

1. We have created a curriculum that attempts to find the optimal sequencing of information. This curriculum is intended to take someone from knowing literally nothing about Web Development to a point where they could be employed as a Junior Developer.
2. For each topic in the curriculum we try to find the best free resources on the internet to teach that topic.  We will often link multiple resources, thereby not relying too much on a single source of information.  If good resources can not be found, we write our own, but we definitely prefer primary link to external sites.
3. We invent and cultivate projects that give learners a chance to practice what they have learned and integrate skills along the way, which increases information retention, giving the learner a chance to experiment and allows the learner to build an impressive portfolio.


Additionally, we have made our learning materials completely open-source.  This means that if anyone comes across a resource that is better than what we currently have included in our lessons, that person is free \(and encouraged!\) to add them, which improves our curriculum over time, and helps it to stay up-to-date.

Sadly, our curriculum \(specifically the Javascript sections\) has become out-of date, and some of the later lessons were never actually finished at all, so we have decided to start fresh with a complete re-write of the JS curriculum, to fill it out and make it current.

## Contributing

This is a gigantic undertaking so we're going to need to follow a bit of a process to make sure things run smoothly and that we do not duplicate our efforts. Please see [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript_curriculum/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.
